- You MAY return an empty plan [] if no action is appropriate.
- Do not invent new fields or actions.
- For "GOTO": params = { "target": "Home" | "Park" }.
- For "SLEEP": params = { "duration": number in ticks } (minutes, 1 tick = 10 minute. For exemple, if you want to sleep 30 minutes, choose 3 ticks).
- For "WAIT": params = { "duration": number } (minutes, 1 tick = 10 minute).
- If "GOTO" has no target, omit "params" and the engine will default to {"target":"Home"}.
